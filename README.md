Research Question  

1. Personality and Career Suitability 

    Research Question: How do personality traits (O_score, C_score, E_score, A_score, N_score) influence the choice of career? 

    Hypothesis: Individuals with high Openness to Experience (O_score) are more likely to pursue creative careers, while those with high Conscientiousness (C_score) are more likely to pursue structured, detailoriented careers (e.g., accounting, law).  

 2. The Relationship Between Personality Traits and Cognitive Aptitudes 

    Research Question: Is there a correlation between personality traits (Big Five scores) and cognitive aptitudes (Numerical, Spatial, Perceptual, Abstract, Verbal Reasoning)? 

    Hypothesis: High Openness to Experience (O_score) might correlate with higher Abstract Reasoning, while Neuroticism (N_score) could negatively correlate with perceptual and reasoning tasks. 

  

 3. Personality Traits as Predictors of Cognitive Aptitude 

    Research Question: Can personality traits be used to predict cognitive aptitudes in a workplace context? 

    Hypothesis: People with high Conscientiousness (C_score) may have better Numerical Aptitude, while those with high Extraversion (E_score) may perform better in tasks involving Verbal Reasoning. 

  

 4. Career Choice and Aptitude Fit 

    Research Question: Are certain careers more likely to attract individuals with specific combinations of aptitudes (Numerical, Spatial, Perceptual) and personality traits? 

    Hypothesis: Artistic careers are more likely to attract people with high Openness (O_score) and Abstract Reasoning, while technical careers (like IT or engineering) may attract people with higher Spatial Aptitude.
